OMNIKAI-Aufbau - Final Summary

Overview
OMNIKAI-Aufbau began as a sparse scaffold and matured through fourteen focused development rounds. Each iteration targeted developer experience, policy clarity, and operational safety while avoiding secret leakage. The repository now hosts concise governance files, minimal yet effective CI checks, and seed assets for prompts and n8n flows.

Key Improvements
- Policies and Guidelines - Added MIT license, contribution guide, and a short Code of Conduct referencing the Contributor Covenant. Standard editor settings and .gitignore promote consistent formatting.
- Structured Collaboration - Introduced issue and pull-request templates alongside branch protection notes to steer reviews and enforce status checks.
- Lightweight CI - Central sanity scripts validate Markdown and JSON, executed both locally and in CI for parity. n8n flow schemas and markdownlint provide early failure signals with clear messages.
- Prompt Clarity - Claude, Gemini, and Grok prompts now define explicit input/output formats, quality criteria, and abort conditions, enabling reliable reuse.
- n8n Flow Skeletons - "Think" and "Execute" flows include minimal Set and Code nodes that operate on environment placeholders, offering safe examples without hard-coded secrets.
- Repository Hygiene - Legacy files were archived, names normalized to kebab-case, and the README synced with the streamlined directory layout.

Current Status
The project scores 9.5/10, reflecting a clean structure, clear policies, and reproducible sanity checks. Remaining enhancements—such as automated tests, security scans, and richer flow logic—are optional extensions rather than immediate needs.

Recommended Next Steps
1. Expand automated test coverage and integrate results into CI.
2. Add security scanning (e.g., dependency audit, secret detection).
3. Grow n8n flows and prompts based on real-world use cases.
4. Publish documentation via GitHub Pages or similar for easier discovery.

Acknowledgements
Thanks to all contributors and reviewers whose iterative refinements brought OMNIKAI-Aufbau to a near-production standard.
