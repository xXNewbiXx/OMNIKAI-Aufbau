# Branch Protection Guidelines

The `main` branch is protected with the following rules:

- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Disallow force pushes and deletions
- Enforce linear history

These settings ensure a stable and auditable code base. Adjust rules via repository settings to match team needs.
