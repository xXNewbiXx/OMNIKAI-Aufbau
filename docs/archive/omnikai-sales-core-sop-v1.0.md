## Executive Summary

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the complete sales pipeline for OMNIKAI from lead generation through payment collection. The process is designed with compliance-by-design principles, frugal-mode economics, and comprehensive audit logging. All activities are orchestrated through n8n workflows with human oversight at critical decision points.

## Process Overview: Lead → Offer → Invoice → Pay

### Stage 1: Lead Generation and Qualification
**Duration:** 1-3 days  
**Automation Level:** 95%  
**Human Intervention:** High-value leads (>€5,000 potential)

The lead generation process begins with multi-channel acquisition including web forms, voice calls, chat interactions, and partner referrals. Each lead is immediately scored using a proprietary algorithm that considers company size, budget indicators, decision-making authority, and timeline urgency. Leads scoring above 75 points are fast-tracked for immediate qualification, while lower-scoring leads enter a nurturing sequence.

All lead data is captured in compliance with GDPR requirements, with explicit consent collected for marketing communications. The system automatically applies data minimization principles, collecting only information necessary for qualification and service delivery. EU leads are processed exclusively within EU infrastructure, with the Transfer Gate preventing any unauthorized data movement.

Lead qualification follows the BANT framework (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) enhanced with OMNIKAI-specific criteria including AI readiness, compliance requirements, and integration complexity. Qualified leads are assigned a unique opportunity ID and enter the proposal generation phase within 24 hours.

**KPIs:**
- Lead response time: <2 hours (target: <30 minutes)
- Qualification rate: >25% of inbound leads
- Lead-to-opportunity conversion: >15%
- Data compliance score: 100% (no violations)

**Abort Criteria (7-14 days):**
- Lead response time >4 hours consistently
- Qualification rate <15%
- GDPR violations detected
- Cost per qualified lead >€200

### Stage 2: Proposal Generation and Presentation
**Duration:** 2-5 days  
**Automation Level:** 80%  
**Human Intervention:** Technical requirements, custom pricing

Proposal generation leverages AI-powered document creation with pre-approved templates and pricing models. The system automatically selects appropriate service packages based on lead qualification data, generates technical specifications, and calculates pricing using dynamic models that consider project complexity, timeline, and strategic value.

All proposals include standardized sections covering service description, technical architecture, compliance framework, implementation timeline, pricing structure, and terms of service. Custom sections are generated based on specific client requirements identified during qualification. Proposals are automatically branded and formatted according to OMNIKAI standards.

The presentation process utilizes multiple channels including video calls, in-person meetings, and interactive demos. Sebastian Horn persona is available for voice-based presentations, providing consistent messaging and professional delivery. All client interactions are logged with consent-based recording for quality assurance and training purposes.

Proposal approval follows a tiered structure: deals under €10,000 are auto-approved using standard terms, deals €10,000-€50,000 require Claude-Flow review, and deals above €50,000 require BOSS approval. This ensures appropriate oversight while maintaining sales velocity.

**KPIs:**
- Proposal generation time: <24 hours
- Proposal-to-meeting conversion: >60%
- Meeting-to-close rate: >30%
- Average deal size: €25,000+

**Abort Criteria (7-14 days):**
- Proposal generation time >48 hours
- Meeting conversion rate <40%
- Close rate <20%
- Average deal size <€15,000

### Stage 3: Contract Negotiation and Closure
**Duration:** 3-10 days  
**Automation Level:** 60%  
**Human Intervention:** Contract terms, legal review, executive approval

Contract negotiation begins with automated term sheet generation based on proposal acceptance and client feedback. The system maintains a library of pre-approved contract clauses covering standard terms, service levels, liability limitations, and compliance requirements. Custom terms require legal review and approval through the escalation process.

Negotiation tracking captures all proposed changes, counteroffers, and final agreements in an immutable audit log. The system automatically flags terms that deviate from standard parameters, requiring appropriate approval levels. Contract versions are managed with full change tracking and electronic signature integration.

Legal review is triggered automatically for contracts containing non-standard terms, international clients, or deals exceeding €50,000. The review process includes compliance verification, risk assessment, and approval documentation. All contracts must pass compliance checks before execution.

Electronic signature collection utilizes DocuSign integration with identity verification and audit trails. The system automatically routes signature requests to appropriate parties and tracks completion status. Signed contracts trigger immediate downstream processes including project initiation and invoicing.

**KPIs:**
- Contract cycle time: <7 days average
- Contract approval rate: >90%
- Electronic signature completion: >95%
- Legal review turnaround: <48 hours

**Abort Criteria (7-14 days):**
- Contract cycle time >14 days average
- Approval rate <80%
- Signature completion <85%
- Legal bottlenecks causing >3 day delays

### Stage 4: Project Initiation and Onboarding
**Duration:** 1-3 days  
**Automation Level:** 85%  
**Human Intervention:** Technical kickoff, stakeholder alignment

Project initiation begins immediately upon contract execution with automated project setup including workspace creation, team assignments, and initial planning. The system generates project charters, communication plans, and milestone schedules based on contract specifications and service templates.

Client onboarding includes account provisioning, access management, and initial training delivery. Technical requirements are validated against service capabilities with any gaps flagged for resolution. Project teams are assembled automatically based on skill requirements and availability.

Kickoff meetings are scheduled within 48 hours of contract signing, including all key stakeholders from both organizations. Meeting agendas are generated automatically with customization based on project specifics. All meetings are recorded with consent for documentation and training purposes.

Initial deliverables are defined and scheduled with automatic progress tracking and milestone reporting. Risk assessment is conducted to identify potential issues and mitigation strategies. Project communication channels are established with appropriate access controls and audit logging.

**KPIs:**
- Project initiation time: <24 hours from contract
- Onboarding completion rate: >95%
- Kickoff meeting attendance: >90%
- Initial milestone achievement: >85%

**Abort Criteria (7-14 days):**
- Initiation time >48 hours consistently
- Onboarding completion <85%
- Meeting attendance <75%
- Milestone achievement <70%

### Stage 5: Invoicing and Payment Collection
**Duration:** 1-30 days  
**Automation Level:** 90%  
**Human Intervention:** Payment issues, collections

Invoicing is triggered automatically based on contract milestones, time tracking, or recurring schedules. Invoice generation includes all required information for compliance including VAT calculations, service descriptions, and payment terms. Multi-currency support accommodates international clients with automatic exchange rate application.

Payment processing supports multiple methods including bank transfers, credit cards, and digital wallets. Payment terms are enforced automatically with reminder sequences for overdue accounts. Early payment discounts and late payment penalties are applied according to contract terms.

Collections management includes automated reminder sequences, escalation procedures, and dispute resolution processes. Payment status is tracked in real-time with automatic updates to project teams and financial systems. Overdue accounts trigger appropriate collection actions including service suspension if necessary.

Financial reporting provides real-time visibility into revenue recognition, cash flow, and collection performance. Integration with accounting systems ensures accurate financial records and compliance with tax requirements. All financial transactions are logged with full audit trails.

**KPIs:**
- Invoice accuracy: >99%
- Payment collection rate: >95%
- Average collection time: <15 days
